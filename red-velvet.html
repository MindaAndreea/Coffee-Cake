          A cupcake (also known as a fairy cake) is a small cake designed to be
          eaten by one person, baked in a thin paper wrapper, and decorated with
          frosting on top.

          One of the mainstays at Coffe & Cake is our famous Red Velvet Cupcake.
          A well-guarded recipe combined with the natural ingredients make this
          little red rascal unapologetically delicious. Topped with decorative
          vanilla frosting, the Red Velvet Cupcake is a favorite among the kids
          as well.
